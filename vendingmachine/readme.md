Vending Machine

As a buyer
1. I insert coins into the machine. I only have 10, 20 and 50 cent coins.
2. I select a single item using the item code.
3. I want my coins back, when i change my mind and no longer want to buy any items
4. I would want my item dispensed and any change owed to me.

Test Data:
Code Name           Price
A1   Coffee         1.50
A2   Lemonade       0.90
B1   Apple Juice    0.70
B2   Tea            1.20

Assumptions:
1. Selecting an item does not dispense the item and you may change the selection
2. When you arrive at the vending machine, it is full of items, no items are selected and no coins have been inserted
3. When the interaction with the machine is completed, the machine should be ready for the next person
